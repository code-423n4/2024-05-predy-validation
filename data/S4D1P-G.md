CONSTANT STATE VARIABLES

The contract has defined state variables whose values are never modified throughout the contract.
The variables whose values never change should be marked as constant to save gas.

Make sure that the values stored in the variables flagged above do not change throughout the contract. If this is the case, then consider setting these variables as constant.
