**Risk rating:** Low / Non-critical

**Report Type:** QA Report

### 1. Lack of clear security documentation

I was unable to find any clear documentation outlining the security measures in place for this project. This makes it difficult to understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities of the system, and makes it harder for developers to maintain and secure the system.

**Recommendation:** Consider creating clear, comprehensive security documentation for this project, outlining the measures in place to protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

### 2. Insecure file permissions

I noticed that a number of files in the repository have insecure file permissions, allowing for read, write, and execute access by other users on the system. This could potentially allow for unauthorized access or modification of these files, leading to security vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:** Consider tightening the file permissions for these files to prevent unauthorized access or modification. In general, it is a good practice to limit file permissions to the minimum necessary to ensure proper operation of the system.

### 3. Use of outdated dependencies

I noticed that a number of the dependencies used in this project are outdated, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:** Consider updating these dependencies to the latest versions to ensure that any known security vulnerabilities are addressed.

### 4. Lack of input validation

I noticed that some user inputs are not properly validated before being processed by the system. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or other forms of malicious input.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing proper input validation for all user inputs, to ensure that they meet the expected format and do not contain any potentially malicious content.

### 5. Lack of encryption for sensitive data

I noticed that some sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys, are stored in plaintext in the codebase. This could potentially allow for unauthorized access to this sensitive data, leading to security vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing encryption for all sensitive data, to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.

### 6. Lack of testing for edge cases

I noticed that some of the code in the repository does not appear to have been thoroughly tested for edge cases. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in the system.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing thorough testing for all edge cases, to ensure that the system behaves as expected in all situations.
